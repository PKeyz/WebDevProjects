        <h1>Philipp Keyzman</h1>
        <p><em>Science student at Ludwid Maximilians University Munich</em></p>
        <p><em>Studied political science at Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz,
            <br>before cancelling and moving on to start learning computer science at the LMU.
            <br>Moving into my forth semester right now I have passed many relevant exams,
            <br>which I never thought would be possible for someone who never had anything to do with CS or mathematics before.
            <br>Right now I am eager to learn Java and WebDevelopment to further deepen my skills and become a real full-stack engineer in my own right.
            <br>Studying computer science more fun than I could've ever imagined and I am looking forward to the journey!
